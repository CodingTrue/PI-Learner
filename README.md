# PI Learner
## About
This repository is for learning how to memorize the infinitely long mathematical constant PI.

The website [piday.org](https://piday.org/) is dedicated about PI and has a really interesting game on it, the [PI-Quiz](https://piday.org/pi-quiz/). I finished the Quiz with its 150 digits after some months of practicing and I wanted to learn more digits. And after only a few hours of work, I made this little replica with up to 4597 digits. And why 4597? This is just the number of digits I copied from [One Million Digits of PI](https://piday.org/million/).

## How to get started?
Clone the repository with
`git clone https://github.com/CodingTrue/PI-Learner.git`
and open the `index.html`. Your browser should now open the file automatically.

Happy learning!
